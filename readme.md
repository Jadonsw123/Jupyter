### Business Understanding

The purpose of the Income Prediction DataSet provided by Zindi is to analyze and classify if a person earns more or less than $50,000 based on various data variables. Specifically, we are given a random population of over 100,000 individuals to test on 200,000 training data. The data is collected from a random American population where the media income was about $50,000 and is provided by the company Zindi. Third parties like Zindi are interested because they will use the machine learning algorithm to classify further individuals and people, giving them a score based on these model accuracy. Furthermore, third parties can use this data in applications like Finance (credit scoring and loans, fraud detection), Healthcare (health insurance and healthcare programs), as well as other areas like HR and Public Policy. The current predicition algorithm that will be considered useful to other parties is that it must be better than 96%, which another person has achieved.
